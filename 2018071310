The fourth paradigm

Data science work flow:
data capture
curate
	find the right data structures
	adding schema and necessary metadata for intepretion
	uncurated data is guaranteed to be lost, we need to choose which data worth living forever, and what metadata should be distilled from it.(reverse common sense)
analysis
	use of database, which should be the location of the data itself not only a place to store it. A good database design for a given discipline should able to answer key 20 questions that scientists ask.(reverse common sense)
	analysis
	modeling
	visualization

Software cost including capital and human resource is far exceeding hardware cost now.

Feff Dozier, William B. Gail
The Emerging Science of Environmental Applications
*	Need driven versus curiosity driven
* Externally constrained
	 Applications science must be prepared to inform actions subject to these external drivers, not according to academic schedules based on when and how the best knowledge can be obtained.
* Consequential and recursive
	 For example, the more we knew in the past about locations of fish populations, the more the populations were overfished; our original knowledge about them became rapidly outdated through our own actions.
* Useful even when incomplete
	New means of making effective use of partial knowledge must be developed, including robust inference engines and statistical interpretation.
* Scalable
* Robust
* Data intensive
	New applications-appropriate sources must be identified, and new ways  of observing (including the use of communities as data gatherers) must be  developed.

Redefining Ecological  Science Using Data
 Science data catalog portals such as SciScope8 and Web services with common data models such as those from the Open Geospatial Consortium9 are evolving.
