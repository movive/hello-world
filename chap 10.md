K. V. Gernaey, J. B. Copp, U. Jeppsson and P. A. Vanrolleghem

This Scientific and Technical Report (STR) summarises the result of approximately 20 years of development work on the different benchmark platforms. Apart from the benchmark platforms themselves, this Task Group has been able to produce a set of verified and platform independent unit process models that are essential for WWTP control strategy evaluation simulation studies. Furthermore, the Task Group has spearheaded the development of a set of generic simulation tools that can be used to support the modelling of activated sludge WWTPs in general. In this chapter, conclusions are drawn on the basis of
our experience with the development and the usage of the benchmark platforms and an outlook towards future developments is provided.

## 10.1 LESSONS LEARNED: DEVELOPMENT OF THE BENCHMARK PLATFORMS

As discussed throughout this STR, the benchmark platforms — BSM1, BSMI_LT and BSM2 — are comprehensive tools and freely available simulation protocols which allow for the objective comparison of WWTP control and/or monitoring strategies.

It is important to emphasise that the development of the benchmark platforms was a voluntary effort for the most part. Considering the large number of scientific papers that have appeared on the development and the use of the benchmark platforms, one important lesson learned is that voluntary work still has a major role to play in the scientific community. Of course, there has been some financial support for meetings and the Task Group is grateful for the support from IWA and the COST actions 682 and 624. Clearly, the development of the benchmark platforms has demonstrated that such support (e.g., COST actions) is important for promoting frequent contact between researchers working in similar areas. This development would not have been possible without that support. Regular face-to-face discussions are indeed essential when embarking on this type ofjourney and these meetings also facilitated the interaction Of MSc and PhD students whose projects were modulated to fit into the benchmark development project.

Another lesson learned from this development is that collaboration between industry and academia is essential for a successful outcome. Indeed, the fact that the development has been supported by a broad and diverse group of people is key to its success in the wastewater modelling and simulation community. and this has been assisted by the fact that the development, from the outset, has been simuation platform independent.

The benchmark development also has resulted in many spin-off benefits. The first indication of these benefits are the ASM1  ring-testing - the confirmation of results using different software platforms and different developers - that carried out  very early on in the BSM1 development. Obscure errors were discovered and simulator-specific issues were identified. Without the rigorous testing that BSM1 required, it is not unreasonable to conclude that those errors might still exist in commercially available software packages. Ring-testing of all the unit process models has, in general, been a very time-consuming exercise, and has been one of the most challenging tasks, but it has provided some of the most important spin-off benefits. Further benefits became apparent during the BSM2 development because a significant amount of time was spent on model development issues such as ADM1 implementation, an influent wastewater generator model, ASM1->ADM1 and ADM1->ASM1 model interfaces, in addition to several others. The effort put into these issues is important because they are generic tools that might be (and already are) used outside of the benchmark environment.

The expansion of BSM1 to include primary clarification and sludge treatment with anaerobic digestion for BSM2 resulted in some interesting developments from a control point of view. An initial draft of BSM2 with the activated sludge tank volumes identical to the BSM1 volumes was presented at WaterMatex2007 (Jeppsson al. 2007). At that time, it was shown using 15 simple control strategies that control of that plant was limited and control authority was insufficient to significantly improve the performance of the highly overloaded plant layout. Interestingly, the high nitrogen load that was causing some of the issues was associated with the reject water, which was not present or accounted for in the BSM1 case. The activated sludge tanks in BSM2 were thus redesigned and the current layout was presented several later by Nopens al. (2010). This layout (compared to the earlier versions) included: (1) a reduced nitrogen load to compensate for the reject water contribution; (2) increased activated sludge tank volumes, compared to BSM1, in order to obtain a WWTP that can benefit from process control; and (3) modifications to the evaluation criteria to distinguish between nitrate and ammonia nitrogen in the effluent quality index, to reduce the aeration impact on the calculated cost index and to differentiate the energy consumption for different pumped flows.

## 10.2 LESSONS LEARNED: USE OF THE BENCHMARK PLATFORMS,VERIFIED PROCESS MODELS AND GENERIC TOOLS
The benchmark platforms have been well received by the research community. BSMI and BSM2 are used frequently for their original purpose (e.g., Vrecko et al. 2002; Stare et al. 2007). They are relatively easy to use because the different parts (unit process models, control strategies, evaluation criteria, are well documented and tend to be immediately recognisable by most users. The concept of benchmarking monitoring strategies, as introduced in BSMI_LT, has been used less frequently thus far, but this benchmark provides a necessary platform nevertheless in a niche area of research. The Task Group hopes that BSMI_LT will receive more interest and be a source of inspiration in the future, as monitoring strategies and methods become increasingly important for WWTPs.

### 10.2.1 Portability

The modular construction of the BSM platform is one of the main reasons for its success. Because the benchmark can be viewed as being the combination of several generic tools, it is relatively easy for a user to pick one or more of these tools and use them in isolation or as part of another study. Furthermore, thissers the ability to add on one or more additional features to the BSM platform without the a significant amount of computer code. This is illustrated with some examples below.
sm er al, (2009, 201 1) used the BESMI plant layout to demonstrate the application of and uncertainty analysis methods. This application was not envisioned when the benchmark was initially discussed, but is an interesting illustration of how the BSM platform has been
a convenient vehicle for the demonstration of new ideas or tools.
In cases, benchmark users have not used the BSM layouts, but have instead used one of the (e.g., the evaluation criteria) to compare control strategy performance on models of other al. (2002) was one of the first to apply the BESMI evaluation criteria to another plant
plantsOdel. Many similar applications of the evaluation criteria can be found in the literature. Other authors have used the BSMI influent data files (dry, storm and rain weather data) or transformations thereof in Oder to simulate a reasonable dynamic influent.
The Task Group is pleased that users take parts of the BSM platform, and use these in their research
However, it is critical that users clearly document what parts they have used and what
prolecl.s.
tßnsformations they have implemented. Unfortunately this is not always the case and the documentation in some studies is insufficient. It is important that the users specify precisely which parts of the BSM platform have been used and also provide a detailed description of any additions. This is essential to ensure that other users understand what has been done and can duplicate the work if necessary.

### 10.2.2 Extensions
With the extension of BSMI to the plant-wide BSM2, the number of potential extensions has increased substantially. Volcke et al. (2006a) were the first to modify the BSM2 layout with reject water treatment. More recently, the Task Group has observed quite a number of publications where the BSM2 plant layout was extended with extra functionality. For example, one known limitation of the BSM biological model is that only one-step nitrification and denitrification are used, but there has been a growing interest in predicting greenhouse gas formation from the treatment process, and N20 — an important nitrification and denitrification intermediate with a high greenhouse gas (GHG) potential — is one of the compounds that is being studied extensively. Multi-step nitrification/denitrification models including N') production have already been implemented in the BSM2 benchmark framework (Flores-Alsina et al. 2011; Corominas e/ al. 2012; Guo et al. 2012; Guo & Vanrolleghem, 2014). Several other potential extensions have been described by Jeppsson et al. (2013). In many cases these add-ons have been defined, implemented and remain the property of individual research groups which contrasts the Task Group's philosophy that verified implementations of the benchmark plants are to be freely distributed. Clearly, the Task Group supports such extensions. It is certainly hoped that these extensions will be made available in the future, and that the documentation of such extensions will be extensive so that the entire research community can benefit. The Task Group invites all interested parties to develop additional tools, but emphasises that model extensions should be ring-tested (e.g., by comparison of two or three independent implementations by different users) before being distributed. Ring-testing these extensions is the best way to ensure the quality of the documentation and the computer code. Although not currently ready, the Task Group is discussing the definition of a suitable protocol to ensure the quality of any additions.

## 10.3 LOOKING AHEAD: FUTURE EXTENSIONS OF THE BSM PLATFORMS

One major conclusion is that the benchmarking work is far from finished. A wish list for future extensions to the BSM platforms was presented in June 2011 at the Watermatex conference in San Sebastian (Spain) by the Task Group chairman, and this work was later published in a journal paper (Jeppsson.et al. 2013) Potential extensions can be subdivided into several caegories including: (1) Temporalextensions，（2）Spatial extensions; (3) Process extensions within the WWTP； (4) Realism of the models used in the BSM; (5) Control strategy extensions; and (6) Extended evalution tools. The most important trends are briefly highlighted here.

### 0.3.1 Temporal extensions
Dynamic simulations with BSMI were based on 14-day influent files depicting dry, rain and conditions, but this approach was shown to be insufficient for long-term control applications age effects and equipment failure scenarios. To address this shortcoming, a phenomenological such sludge wastewater generator model was developed to cope with the challenge of providing realistic innuen, (1—2 years) influent data 10 the BSMs. Even longer influent data files might be required for future analyses. For example. the simulation of changes in urban catchments and the impact on treatment scenano efficiency might require evaluation periods in excess of ten years. The ever-increasing plant power would allow an extended evaluation period; however, the practical relevance of results computationalbased received such extended in the simulations future. would likely be highly uncertain. Nevertheless, such an extension may be well.

### 10.3.2 Spatial extensions
The benchmark platforms described in this STR are defined as 'within-the-fence' systems, that IS, the model descriptions and simulations do not extend outside the borders of the WWTP. The importance of the sewer system and processes in the receiving waters were recognised by the Task Group but including these complicating filctors in the original BSMs was deemed to be beyond the Task Group's scope. From a control and monitoring perspective the inclusion of the sewer network into the benchmark system would open up a range of new possibilities for interactions and manipulation of the combined sewer/WWTP system (e.g., back-flow effects, storm tanks and pumping stations, combined sewer overflows, pollution contributions from run-off). Examples of integrated sewer and WWTP modelling can be found in Sharma et al. (2012) and an initial combined benchmarking study connecting the sewer model with BSM2 was performed by Guo et al. (2012). As for receiving waters, existing models such as the River Water Quality Model No. I (Reichert et al. 2001) could be added or linked to the BSMs without too much difficulty given that the model interfaces have already been developed (Benedetti et al. 2007). This kind of approach would be particularly beneficial for a more detailed evaluation of the environmental impact of wastewater pollutants. Moreover, such a combination would promote the use of the benchmark system as a decision support tool in agreement with current river basin management approaches, as pursued for example by the EU Water Framework Directive.

Integrated evaluation experience can be found in Benedeti et al.(2010) and Brehmer et al.(2009). As with the benchmarking tools developed so far, consensus will have to be reached on objective evaluation criteria that assess the urban water quality iimpacts in receiving waters, but ideas for this are being developed(e.g., Bauwens et al. 1996; Vanrolleghem et al. 2005a; Benedetti et al. 2010; Clouzot et al. 2013).

### 10.3.3 Process extensions
Process extensions within the WWTP are related to the appearance of models for new unit processes, such as the SHARON and ANaerobic AMMonium Oxidation(Anammox) processes (Volcke et al. 2006a). The Task Group expects the this evolution will continue in the future. The Task Group has recognised an immediate need for process extensions related to integrated fixed-film processes(Vanhooren et al. 2002) and SBR configurations. Note that these process extensions will have to be coupled to suitable model interfaces if the state variables in the new model differ from the state variables in the original benchmark models. As discussed previously in this STR, these interfaces ensure that material mass balances and community principles are met when mapping the output variables of one model to the most appropriate input variables of another model （Alex et al. 2005; Vanrolleghem et al. 2005b; Volcke et al. 2006b; Nopens et al. 2009) and these issues are critical for acceptance within the moelling community.

### 10.3.4 Realism of models used in BSMs
mathematical models used in the benchmark platforms were chosen because they are internationally and uvll established. The Task Group is aware of the limitations in the chosen models; but. is a"are of the fact that there is an almost limitless possibility to extend and upgrade the models the existing BSM plant configurations, including the models describing sensors and actuators (e.g., detailed and dynamic models of blowers and pumps). It is unequivocally hoped that the aim of any "Ollld be to enhance realism of the systems rather than to simply increase the level of detail cotnplc\lty. In some cases, improved models have become available and although the Task Group not to change models during the development phase, most of these updated models are well and could be interchanged within the current BSM framework. For example, future extensions may Include phosphorus removal, multi-step nitrification/denitrification and N') production, inclusion of sulphur tvducing/oxidising reactions, improved thickener and dewatering models, improved settler Inclusion of soluble microbial products formation and extensions for physico-chemical processes. Furthcrtnore. the BSM structure provides a framework to test models under development (e.g., Guo & Vanrolleghem. 2014).

### 10.3.5 Control strategy extensions
Advances In instrumentation and automation allow us to have access to highly accurate information regarding the urban wastewater system in real-time. Not only can this information be acquired from the WWTP. but on-line sensors can be installed in the sewer systems, and monitoring stations are being doeloped for monitoring river water quality (Copp et al. 2010). These developments are producing large quantities of data that can be used for fault-tolerant, uncertainty-aware and system-wide control design ()lsson et al 2005; Olsson, 2012). Certainly, the benchmark platforms will be used in the future to test new control strategies and the Task Group hopes that these new trends in process control, applied to the benchmark platforms, might contribute to our understanding on how such new control strategies can contribute to improving the operation of full-scale WWTPs.

### 10.3.6 Extended evaluation tools
TtE performance evaluation in the current benchmark platforms is based on three main types of evaluation ct*na (effluent quality, operational cost issues and process risks). Effluent quality is considered through aeffluent quality index (EQI), costs for energy, sludge and chemicals are considered through an operating index (()CI) and process risk is considered through a fuzzy logic calculation of microbiologyrlaled operational problems to create a risk index. The wish list for future expansions of the evaluation mena contains energy consumption models, validation and extension of the risk calculation concerning mkmbiology-related TSS separation problems, inclusion of capital and maintenance costs, robust &ettmnty based evaluation of control strategies (e.g., the robustness index proposed by Vanrolleghem & Gillot. 2002), as well as a set of criteria to capture greenhouse gas emissions and the WWTP (e.g., the proposal discussed in Corominas et al. 2012).

### 10.4 THE 'BENCHMARKING SPIRIT'
Two central elements in the benchmarking community philosophy have been the development of validated models and the free distribution of the verified models. All of this has been possible because of a tremendous amount of voluntary work. With over 400 scientific papers published over the years, the results of that voluntary effort are very impressive.

It is the Task Group's sincere hope that this report will inspire research groups to carry on the development effort allowing it to flourish and continue to be a state-of-the-art tool for research, model development and practical application of control within the field of wastewater treatment. This STR is the culmination of this stage in the BSM development, but with so many possibilities for expansion and improvement, hopefully a new wave of motivated scientists will foster new like-minded life-long friendships and continue the development well into the future.
