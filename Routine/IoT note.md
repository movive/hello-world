IEC 41699
  Figure 3.2 provides an example of tool support for the graphical display of the
  mapping between the SORT application and the SENSOR and ACTUATOR devices
  via the labels attached to the bottom of the mapped function blocks. Since
  this tool support is not defined in the IEC 61499 standard, various tools, e.g.,
  FBDK [5] and 4DIAC [8], may provide differing kinds of support.
