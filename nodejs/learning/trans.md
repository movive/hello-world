Aiming at a series of problems and needs faced by water environment management in China's industrial parks: such as poorly designed water supply, drainage system and wastewater collection system; complex production wastewater, complicated wastewater treatment, low water reuse rate; lack of effective monitoring and early warning measures, difficulties in operation, supervision and fee collecting; unestablished inter-enterprises resource/energy cycle. This project has studied, verified and demonstrated three environmental service models, a one-stop environmental service model for multi-tenant industrial parks, a universial environmental construction management model for specialized industrial parks and an integrated environmental utilities for key industrial parks. The project developed a series of new technologies, new products and new equipment for industrial park wastewater treatment, including energy-saving MBR suite, combination of efficient ammonia removal enzyme-microbe and BAF bio-enhancement technology, non-membrane advanced wastewater treatment process, etc. These new technologies, new products have been tested through laboratory and on-site pilot scale. Some research results have been applied to practical projects.
